OMG, just finished Mountainhead and I'm not even sure what to think. It's like my brain's been thrown off a cliff, lol. It's one of those  s that leaves you kinda dizzy, you know? Seriously, some plot twists just came outta nowhere. Like, what was even happening at some points? First half, I’m telling you, I was just happy I'd 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   and then bam—it’s like a rollercoaster that forgot what gravity feels like.

The acting was, you know, surprisingly good though. I wasn’t expecting much when I decided to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   honestly, but they really did a solid job bringing those characters to life. But still, why was everyone whispering all the dang time? Like, speak up folks, I’m not trying to guess your dialogue over here. And the scenery was just chef’s kiss. I swear, I almost booked a mountain trip right there and then, haha.

> So get this—midway through, my cat decided she needed all the attention. I’m over here trying to follow what felt like a meeting of plot twists and she's demanding cuddles. Seriously (and magically), she only ever does this during the intense scenes. It's like she knows exactly when to mess with me! She’s the real mastermind behind the chaos, I’m convinced. Maybe she could replace one of the plotlines, and no one would even notice.

Anyway, not to spoil anything, but the ending kinda left me hanging. Question marks everywhere, like okay, is this a setup for a sequel, or did I just miss something while I was internally screaming? I mean, I might need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 just to catch the stuff I was too distracted to get the first time. But geez, who has time for reruns these days when the to-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 list is already endless, am I right?

let me = need caffeine now; // Why am I even typing code here? Random brain moment.

In any case, if you haven't seen it yet, maybe give it a whirl when you're in the mood for some cinematic whiplash. It's one of those when you just feel like going what on earth? but in like, a fun, unexpected way. Hit me up if you decide to give it a go—I need someone to validate or debunk my ramblings, haha.
